single vs double quotes used properly for ${} expansion
all filenames wrapped with single quotes unless a ${} inside


icons:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec
xdg-icon-resource
xdg-mime
is mime glob case-insensitive?
xdg-desktop-icon for .desktop file
add [ -f COPYING.txt ] || exit 99 to all scripts
does every script work on re-run?
